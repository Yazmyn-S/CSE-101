Matrix.h
Contains well defined and relevant constructors, destructors, functions, and structures for expanded upon in Matrix.c, and utilized in Sparse.c and MatrixTest.c


MatrixTest.c
Contains a test client that runs all of the Matrix operations to confirm that they all run properly.


Sparse.c
Takes the Matrix operations from Matrix.c to quickly sparse through a given matrix and provide fast solutions to a variety of questions about the given Matrix.


Makefile 
Allows the programmer to compile, test, and run code to ensure a functional compilation free of errors. It will notify the programmer of any errors with the code before ever placing the code in the class gradescript. The make file also creates and erases .o files 


README.md
Provides a list of all submitted files and a description of each one sometimes accompanied by a note. (This is a Readme file.)
