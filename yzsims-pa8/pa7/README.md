Description
Notes
Dictionary.h 
Contains well defined and relevant constructors, destructors, functions, and structures for a Dictionary ADT expanded upon in Dictionary.cpp, and utilized in Order.cpp and DictionaryTest.cpp


Dictionary.cpp 
Implements a Dictionary ADT as a binary tree.


DictionaryTest.cpp  
Contains a test client that runs all of the Dictionary operations to confirm that they all run properly.


Order.cpp
Orders the dictionary keys in alphabetical order.


Makefile 
Allows the programmer to compile, test, and run code to ensure a functional compilation free of errors. It will notify the programmer of any errors with the code before ever placing the code in the class gradescript. The make file also creates and erases .o files 


README.md
Provides a list of all submitted files and a description of each one sometimes accompanied by a note. (This is a Readme file.)

List.c 
Implements a List ADT as adjacency list. The ADT is used to find the shortest path is FindPath.c. 


Graph.c
Implements a Graph ADT as a doubly-linked list. The ADT is used to perform DFS.


Graph.h

GraphTest.c  
Contains a test client that runs all of the Graph operations to confirm that they all run properly.


FindComponents.c
Uses the Graph ADT to find all the strongly connected vertices through DFS.
