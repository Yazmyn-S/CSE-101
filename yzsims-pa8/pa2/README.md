Description
Notes
List.h 
Contains well defined and relevant constructors, destructors, functions, and structures for expanded upon in List.c.


List.c 
Implements a List ADT as adjacency list. The ADT is used to find the shortest path is FindPath.c. 


Graph.c
Implements a Graph ADT as a doubly-linked list. The ADT is used to order an array of elements in Lex.c. 


Graph.h
Contains well defined and relevant constructors, destructors, functions, and structures for/expanded upon in Graph.c, and utilized in FindPath.c and GraphTest.c


GraphTest.c  
Contains a test client that runs all of the Graph operations to confirm that they all run properly.


FindPath.c
Uses the Graph ADT to find the shortest paths between two vertices in a graph using the breadth first search method.


Makefile 
Allows the programmer to compile, test, and run code to ensure a functional compilation free of errors. It will notify the programmer of any errors with the code before ever placing the code in the class gradescript. The make file also creates and erases .o files 


README.md
Provides a list of all submitted files and a description of each one sometimes accompanied by a note. (This is a Readme file.)
